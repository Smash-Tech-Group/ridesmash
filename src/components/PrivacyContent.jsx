</div>

<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify font-bold'>
1. Data provided by users, which includes:</p>
</div>

<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>

User profile: We collect data when users create or update their Accounts. This may include their name, email, phone number, username and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), government identification documents (including driver’s license numbers and images), birthdate, signature and/or photo. This may also include vehicle or insurance information of drivers and user settings. We may use information (including photos) submitted by users to verify their identities or Account usage, such as, for example, cross-referencing public databases and/or using facial recognition technologies. For more information, please see the section titled “How we use personal data.”
</p>


<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>

Background check and identity verification: We may collect background check and identity verification information for drivers who establish an account with us directly. This may include information such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted or required by applicable law) and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on RIDESMASH ’s behalf.
</p>

<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold'>User content: </span>We collect the information users submit when they contact RIDESMASH, including for customer support. This may include feedback, photographs or other recordings collected by users, as well recordings of telephone calls or other communications between users and RIDESMASH.
</p>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify font-bold'>
2. Data created during use of our Platform or Services, which includes:
</p>
</div>
<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold'>Location data: </span>We collect precise or approximate location data from a user’s mobile device if enabled by the user to do so. For drivers, RIDESMASH collects this data either from RIDESMASH equipment installed in the vehicles or when the RIDESMASH driver App is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile devices. For passengers, RIDESMASH collects this data when the passenger is engaged in a trip and the RIDESMASH passenger App is running in the foreground or the background. For payers and payees, RIDESMASH collects this data from the RIDESMASH equipment or Apps through which payments are made. Passengers may use certain Apps without enabling RIDESMASH to collect location data from their mobile devices; however, this may affect some functionality available in such Apps. For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection in the RIDESMASH passenger App will have to manually enter his or her pickup address when making a transportation request. In addition, the location data collected from a RIDESMASH or driver device during a trip or a payment may be linked to the user’s account, even if the user has not enabled location data to be collected from his, her or its device, including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance and/or litigation.

</p>

<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold'>Transaction and Payment information: </span>
 We collect transaction information (including payment information) related to the use of our Platform or Services, including the type of Services requested or provided, request details, trip information, date and time the Service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled and payment method.
 </p>
 <p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold'>Usage data: </span>
We collect data about how users interact with our Platform and Services. This includes data such as access dates and times, App or Site features or pages viewed, App or Site crashes and other system activity, type of browser and third-party sites or services used before interacting with our Platform and Services. In addition, if you visit our Sites, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. The information collected in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on the Sites and dates and times of Site visits. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we may obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As a visitor clicks through our website, a record of the action may be collected and stored. Certain data elements collected through automated means, such as your browser information, may be linked with other information otherwise obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.

<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>

<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold'>Communications data: </span>

 We may enable users to communicate with each other and/or RIDESMASH through our Apps, Sites, email, text message, telephone and/or other means. For example, we enable drivers and passengers to call, text or send other files to each other (generally without disclosing their telephone numbers to each other). To provide this service, RIDESMASH receives some data regarding the calls, texts or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and the content of the communications. RIDESMASH may also use this data for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes (including fraud prevention), to improve our products and services and/or for analytics.

A. Privacy settings
</p>
</div>

<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>
RIDESMASH provides users with trip status notifications and updates related to activity on their account. These notifications are a necessary part of using the RIDESMASH app and cannot be disabled. However, users may choose the method by which they receive these notifications through the settings,  Profile,  Push Notifications menu in the RIDESMASH app. Disabling push notifications may limit your ability to use our Services.
A passenger can adjust his or her location-sharing preferences in the settings menus of his or her mobile device. The RIDESMASH mobile App uses passengers’ device location services to make it easier to arrange a trip whenever they need one. Location data helps improve our services, including pickups, navigation and customer support. Disabling our Apps’ access to your device’s location services may limit your ability to use our Services.

B. Device permissions
</p>
</div>

<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owner’s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained. iOS devices notify users the first time the RIDESMASH app requests permission to access certain types of data and gives users the option to grant or refuse permission. Android devices notify users of the permissions that the RIDESMASH app seeks before their first use of the app, and use of the app constitutes a grant of such permission.
</p>
</div>

<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify font-bold'>
D. Marketing opt-outs
