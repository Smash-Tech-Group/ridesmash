These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and Ridesmash, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, “Ridesmash,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the Ridesmash applications, websites, technology, facilities, and platform (collectively, the “Ridesmash Platform”).

</p>
<p className=' md:text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
PLEASE BE ADVISED: THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN HOW CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND RIDESMASH CAN BE BROUGHT (SEE SECTION 17 BELOW). THESE PROVISIONS WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU TO: (1) WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND (2) SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST RIDESMASH TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, GROUP OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

<p className=' md:text-gray-500 md:my-3 roboto text-justify'>
By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Ridesmash Platform, you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE RIDESMASH PLATFORM OR ANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE RIDESMASH PLATFORM. If you use the Ridesmash Platform in another country, you agree to be subject to Ridesmash’s terms of service for that country. If you are accessing or using the Ridesmash Platform to access or use Ridesmash Business services on behalf of an organization contracted with Ridesmash, and you are not accessing or using the Ridesmash Platform as a Rider or Driver, your access and use is governed by the contract between Ridesmash and your organization.
</p>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
When using the Ridesmash Platform, you also agree to conduct yourself in accordance with our Community Guidelines, which shall form part of this Agreement between you and Ridesmash.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
The Ridesmash Platform provides a marketplace where, among other things, persons who seek transportation to certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to such destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers, Riders, and any other individuals, excluding any Excluded Individuals, using the Ridesmash Platform are collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders, and other transportation related services provided by Drivers in connection with the Ridesmash Platform, shall be referred to herein as “Rideshare Services.” “Ridesmash Services” shall include any service provided by Ridesmash pursuant to the Ridesmash Platform (for clarity, Ridesmash Services does not include Rideshare Services or Third-Party Services). As a User, you authorize Ridesmash to match and/or re-match you with Drivers or Riders based on factors such as your location, the requested pickup location, the estimated time to pickup, your destination, User preferences, ride mode, driver mode, membership status, regulatory or other third-party requirements, user statistics, and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match based on the same or other considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. A separate agreement is formed between Drivers and Riders when the Rider accepts the Rideshare Services offered by the Driver. As used herein, “Excluded Individuals” means any individual who is registering to use the Ridesmash Platform or whose use of the Ridesmash Platform is on behalf of an organization contracted with Ridesmash, except as a Rider or Driver.


</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent transportation modalities (e.g., bikes, scooters, cars, etc.) or be offered other services through the Ridesmash Platform. In some markets, some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned and operated by Ridesmash. In other markets, some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned or operated by third parties.
</p>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
In any case, your use of Ridesmash Services through the Ridesmash Platform may be subject to additional agreements between you and Ridesmash as applicable to the particular service in the particular market (“Supplemental Agreements”). Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT RENT OR USE RIDESMASH SERVICES IN SUCH MARKET. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Supplemental Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control, unless such Supplemental Agreement specifically states otherwise.

Ridesmash reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Ridesmash Platform after any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. Unless material changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if applicable).

The Ridesmash Platform is not available to Users who have had their User account temporarily or permanently deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User account, you agree that you are the sole authorized user of your User account, and you may not use your User account on behalf of any third party, except as otherwise expressly permitted by Ridesmash.

</p>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto font-bold text-xl'>Charges</p>
</div>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
As a User, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services, Ridesmash Services, or Third-Party Services may result in charges (“Charges”) to you and/or to an organization, if applicable. Charges to Riders and/or organizations, if applicable, for Rideshare Services include Fares (defined below) and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes, including as set forth on your market’s Ridesmash Cities page (“Ridesmash Cities Page”), plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to pay. Ridesmash has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your market’s Ridesmash Cities Page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., shared, economy, extra seats, luxury) as described on your market’s Ridesmash Cities Page or within the Ridesmash Platform. You are responsible for reviewing the applicable Ridesmash Cities Page or price quote within the Ridesmash Platform and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
</p>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto font-bold text-xl'>Rideshare Service Fares (“Fares”). There are two types of Fares, Estimated and variable.</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold '>Estimated Fares.</span> When you make a ride request using the Ridesmash Platform, Ridesmash will quote you a Fare at the time of your request. The estimated is subject to change until the ride request is confirmed. If your final destination is not the same as the destination in your ride request, or the time or distance of your ride differs substantially from your quoted fare, or if you attempt to abuse the Ridesmash Platform, we may, at Ridesmash’s sole discretion and determination, cancel the fare quote and charge you a variable fare as described below. Ridesmash does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare for the same ride. Quoted fares may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as applicable.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold '>Variable Fares.</span>
 Variable fares consist of a base charge and incremental charges based on the time and distance of your ride. For particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS data from your Driver’s phone to calculate the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal, we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride. In addition to the variable fare, the total cost of your ride may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as applicable.</p>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto font-bold text-xl'>Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges.</p>
</div>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto'><span className='font-bold '>Service Fee.</span> Ridesmash may charge a “Service Fee” for each ride, as set forth on the applicable Ridesmash Cities Page.</p>
</div>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold '>Prime Time.</span> At certain times, including times of high demand for Rideshare Services (“Prime Time”), you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For quoted fares, we may factor in Prime Time increases into the quoted price of the ride.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold '>Priority Pickup and Wait & Save.</span>  In some cases, you may be able to select an expected pick up that is faster or slower than standard for a higher or lower Fare, respectively.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
<span className='font-bold '>Cancellation Fee.</span> After requesting a ride, you may cancel it through the Ridesmash Platform, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply. Ridesmash may also charge a fee if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please check out our Help Center to learn more about Ridesmash’s rider cancellation policy.
Damage Fee. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250 depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Ridesmash in its sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. Ridesmash reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee.
</p>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'><span className='font-bold '>Abuse Fee.</span> 
If we receive a credible report that you have misused or abused the Ridesmash Platform, you agree to pay an “Abuse Fee” of up to $250 as determined by Ridesmash in its sole discretion. Ridesmash reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of abuse prior to processing the Abuse Fee.
Tolls. In some instances, tolls, toll estimates, or return tolls may apply to your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market’s Ridesmash Cities Page for more information about toll charges. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Ridesmash will match the toll charged to the Driver, if any.
</p>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'><span className='font-bold '>Other Charges.</span>
 Other fees and surcharges may apply to your ride, including, but not limited to: actual or anticipated airport fees, state fees, local fees, event fees, fuel surcharges, wait time fees, or distance surcharges as determined by Ridesmash or its marketing partners. In addition, where required by law Ridesmash will collect applicable taxes. See your market’s Ridesmash Cities Page for information on other Charges that may apply to your ride.</p>
 <p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Tips. Following a ride, you may have the opportunity to elect to tip your Driver in cash or through the Ridesmash Platform. You may also elect to set a default tip amount or percentage through the Ridesmash Platform. Any tips will be provided entirely to the applicable Driver.
</p>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'><span className='font-bold '>Charges Generally.</span>
Facilitation of Charges. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processor (flutterwaves, PayPal, Inc., etc.). Ridesmash may replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you. With the exception of tips and the purchase of Ridesmash Cash, cash payments are strictly prohibited unless expressly permitted by Ridesmash. Your payment of Charges to Ridesmash satisfies your payment obligation for your use of the Ridesmash Platform, Ridesmash Services, Third-Party Services, and Rideshare Services. Certain Charges may be collectively billed as a single purchase transaction to your selected payment method based on the payment frequency indicated in your settings. If your primary payment method expires, is invalid, or if Charges to your primary payment method are unable to be processed for whatever reason, then you agree that Ridesmash may charge your other available payment methods in the Ridesmash Platform. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your ride receipts and payment history.</p>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto font-bold text-xl'>No Refunds.</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
All Charges are non-refundable except to the extent required by law. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the Ridesmash Platform, any disruption to the Ridesmash Platform, Ridesmash Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services, or any other reason whatsoever.
</p>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto font-bold text-xl'>Coupons.</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
 You may receive coupons, credits, discounts, or other promotions (collectively, “Coupons”) that you can apply toward payment of certain Charges. Coupons are valid only for use on the Ridesmash Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. Coupons cannot be combined unless expressly provided otherwise, and if the cost of your Charges exceeds the applicable Coupon value, we may charge your payment method on file for the Charges in excess of the Coupon amount. With respect to Fares, Ridesmash may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee, Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the Coupon. Additional restrictions on Coupons may apply as communicated to you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant Coupon within the Rewards section of the Ridesmash Platform.
 </p>
 <div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto font-bold text-xl'>Supplemental Charges.</p>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Charges related to Ridesmash Services (including the rental of bikes and scooters) may be further detailed in the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
</p>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto font-bold text-xl'>Third-Party Charges.</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
 If you choose to purchase Third-Party Services (described further in Section 20) through the Ridesmash Platform, you authorize your payment method on file to be charged according to the pricing terms set by Ridesmash or the third-party provider, or as otherwise provided in the terms of the purchased services.
Payment Card Authorization. Upon addition of a new payment method or each request for Ridesmash Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services, Ridesmash may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the Charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid card. Ridesmash is not responsible for these charges and is unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to learn more about our use of pre-authorization holds.
For clarity, Ridesmash does not charge a fee for Users to access the Ridesmash Platform, but retains the right to charge Users and/or organizations, if applicable, a fee or any other Charge for accessing or using Ridesmash Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services made available through the Ridesmash Platform.

You own, or have the legal right to operate, the vehicle you use when providing Rideshare Services; such vehicle is in good operating condition and meets the industry safety standards and all applicable statutory and state department of motor vehicle requirements for a vehicle of its kind; and any and all applicable safety recalls have been or will be remedied per manufacturer instructions.

</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
You will not attempt to defraud Ridesmash or Riders on the Ridesmash Platform or in connection with your provision of Rideshare Services.

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
You have a valid policy of liability insurance (in coverage amounts consistent with all applicable legal requirements) that names or schedules you for the operation of the vehicle you use to provide Rideshare Services, and you agree to provide proof of such insurance and that information regarding such insurance may be released to Ridesmash upon Ridesmash’s reasonable request.

</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND RIDESMASH MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS (“CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND RIDESMASH BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SUBSECTION (B) SHALL NOT APPLY TO REPRESENTATIVE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST RIDESMASH, WHICH ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY IN SECTION 17(C).
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then that Claim or particular remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall be severed from any remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims or remedies to the fullest extent possible.

(c) Representative PAGA Waiver.
</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Ridesmash agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Ridesmash agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.

(d) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
</p>
</div>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of these rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) (the “AAA Rules”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding. The parties may select a different arbitration administrator upon mutual written agreement.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
As part of the arbitration, both you and Ridesmash will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(e) Arbitration Fees and Awards.
</p>
</div>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>

The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA Rules subject to the following modifications:
</p>
</div>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
If Ridesmash initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Ridesmash will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
</p>
</div>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
With respect to any Claims brought by Ridesmash against a Driver, or for Claims brought by a Driver against Ridesmash that: (A) are based on an alleged employment relationship between Ridesmash and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Ridesmash’s actual deactivation of a Driver’s User account or a threat by Ridesmash to deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, Ridesmash’s actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with Ridesmash under the termination provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Ridesmash to terminate a Driver’s Agreement; (D) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including Ridesmash’s commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly guarantees owed by Ridesmash to Drivers for Rideshare Services, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other Ridesmash promotions, or consumer-type disputes, or (E) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in connection with a user seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(E) shall be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”), Ridesmash shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the extent not paid by Ridesmash pursuant to the fee provisions above). However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1) above. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(2), the term “Driver” shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have not been approved to drive.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
</p>
<div className='flex w-full justify-start'>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.
</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Although under some laws Ridesmash may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Ridesmash agrees that it will not seek such an award unless you are represented by an attorney or the arbitrator has determined that the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Ridesmash’s last written settlement offer made after you participated in good faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k) below, then Ridesmash will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000, whichever is greater.

(f) Location and Manner of Arbitration.
</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Unless you and Ridesmash agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Ridesmash and a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address, and any arbitration hearings between Ridesmash and a Driver will take place in the county in which the Driver provides Rideshare Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration. Your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.

(g) Exceptions to Arbitration.
</p>
</div>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and (5) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection with the use of the Ridesmash Platform, Ridesmash Services, or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, Ridesmash will not require arbitration of those claims. Ridesmash’s agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not waive the enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement (including without limitation the waivers provided in Section 17(b)), or of the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other dispute, claim, or controversy.
</p>
<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>

Should you participate in an NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision or settled by you. Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision.

(i) Driver Claims in Pending Settlement.
</p>
</div>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
If you are a member of a putative class in a lawsuit against Ridesmash involving Driver Claims and a Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Settlement has been filed with the court in that lawsuit prior to this Agreement’s effective date (a “Pending Settlement Action”), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to your Driver Claims in that particular class action. Instead, your Driver Claims in that Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration

 provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you accepted prior to this Agreement’s effective date.

(j) Opting Out of Arbitration for Driver Claims That Are Not In a Pending Settlement Action.

</p>
</div>



<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate Driver Claims defined in Section 17(e)(2) (except as limited by Section 17(i) above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in Ridesmash’s Terms of Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified below, but opting out of this arbitration provision has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Ridesmash. If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration provision and do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims, you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such Driver Claims, other than those in a Pending Settlement Action, by notifying Ridesmash in writing of your desire to opt out of arbitration for such Driver Claims, which writing must be dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to arbitrationoptout@Ridesmash.com.
</p>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending Settlement Action, (B) the writing must include the name, phone number, and email address associated with your User Account, and (C) the email containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days after the date this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the 30-day period, you and Ridesmash shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement in full (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending Settlement Action). As provided in paragraph 17(i) above, any opt out that you submit shall not apply to any Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action and your Driver Claims in any such Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions that are contained in the applicable Ridesmash Terms of Use that you agreed to prior to the effective date of this Agreement.
</p>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>
Cases have been filed against Ridesmash and may be filed in the future involving Driver Claims. You should assume that there are now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against Ridesmash alleging class, collective, and/or representative Driver Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree to arbitration of Driver Claims with Ridesmash under this Arbitration Agreement, you are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief, against Ridesmash in an individual arbitration, except for the Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action. You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class, collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to assert claims or opt- out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration Agreement.

</p>
</div>

<p className=' text-gray-500 my-3 roboto text-justify'>

A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or as this could violate HIPAA non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.
